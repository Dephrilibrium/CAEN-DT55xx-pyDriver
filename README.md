# DT55xx-pyDriver
Python driver for CAEN DT55xx devices

This python-driver is for controlling CAEN-DT55xx devices. But due to missing hardware, no tests are done until now! From experience, this driver is not ready to use and needs a lot of improvements.
Classes and Enumerations are also must be shifted into a separate file (after tests and bugfixes are done).
